# Introduction

This project is my attempt to learn basics of Spring boot, Spring REST, Spring Data JPA and Unit testing of APIs using Mockito. 

### Phase 1 (Done) - Documentation of REST API: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/13299377/TzsZr8PS
Creating a Simple CRUD API using Spring REST. 
Connecting to MySQL Database using Spring JPA and performing CRUD operations. 

### Phase 2
Writing Unit tests using Mockito to test the API.
